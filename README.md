## Feature Categories

- **Demographics**: gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents
- **Services**: PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies
- **Contract & Billing**: tenure, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, Charges.Monthly, Charges.Total, Charges.Daily
- **Churn Label**: Churn (target for churn prediction/analysis)

***

## Notes on Key Features

1. **Churn** is the primary outcome variable, vital for retention and lifetime value analysis.
2. **Service features** (Internet, security, tech support, streaming) allow for customer service-bundle analysis.
3. **Contract and tenure** indicate customer loyalty and predictability of future churn.
4. **Billing and payment features** (monthly, total, daily charges, payment method, paperless preference) are critical for understanding customer value and payment trends.
5. **Demographic variables** support segmentation by age (SeniorCitizen), household, and gender, which can identify at-risk groups or those with high lifetime value.
6. String-based features often use three categories to explicitly separate "no service" situations from an active "No" (e.g., "No internet service" vs. "No").

## Use Cases Enabled by Dataset

- **Churn Prediction Modeling** (using all features)
- **Customer Segmentation** (demographics, services, billing)
- **Product Bundle Analysis** (which services/bundles reduce churn)
- **Lifetime Value Calculation** (combining tenure and charges)
- **Payment Method Impact Studies** (analyzing churn/payment method interaction)
- **Paperless Billing Adoption Analysis** (environmental initiatives, cost-based studies)

The dataset structure is ideal for both supervised machine learning and exploratory customer value analysis. It captures the essential variables for understanding how customer characteristics, product adoption, and billing behaviors interact to drive retention and churn.
